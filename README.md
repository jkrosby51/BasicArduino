# BasicArduino

**Finite LED Blinker**
Very simple, didn't take much time nor effort.

**LED Blinker Revisited**
Similar to the last assignment. I didn't need to learn anything new, just a refresher to C++.

**Hello Functions**
Still fairly simple, but did give a refresher on a lot of topics at once. This assignment took a bit more time and required me to look some things up.
